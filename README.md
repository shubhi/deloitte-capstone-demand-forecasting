Explainable AI Demand Forecasts for Retailers
=============================================

Project Overview
----------------

This project, sponsored by **Deloitte Consulting**'s ConvergeCONSUMER Group, aims to develop a proof-of-concept (POC) demand forecasting solution for a retail superstore chain. The goal is to leverage **AI/ML models** to deliver more accurate and explainable demand forecasts, addressing gaps in traditional forecasting methods.

Problem Statement
-----------------

Retailers face increasing supply chain volatility, which impacts inventory management and logistics. Traditional forecasting methods lack flexibility and adaptability to rapidly changing market conditions, limiting the decision-makers' ability to make proactive adjustments.

### Objectives

*   Build a modernized demand forecasting prototype using **advanced AI/ML models**.
    
*   Provide **transparent and explainable** outputs to aid decision-making.
    
*   Support **inventory management** and **scenario analysis** for internal and external factors.
    

Target Outcomes
---------------

*   **Improved Forecast Accuracy:** Using AI/ML models to outperform traditional techniques.
    
*   **Explainability:** Providing insights into the factors driving demand predictions.
    
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Evaluate internal and external variables such as sales trends, GDP, and CPI.
    
*   **Optimized Inventory Management:** Tighter control over stock to prevent stockouts and reduce operational costs.
    

Scope
-----

### In-Scope

*   Collect anonymized **sales data** from the superstore chain.
    
*   Compare **traditional forecasting methods** with **AI/ML approaches**.
    
*   Focus on a subset of general merchandise items with stable sales histories.
    
*   Develop a **proof of concept** demonstrating enhanced accuracy and explainability.
    

### Out-of-Scope

*   Full-scale production deployment of the forecasting solution.
    
*   Integration with ERP, CRM, or POS systems beyond the proof of concept.
    

Evaluation Metrics
------------------

*   **Forecast Accuracy:** Metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE will be used.
    
*   **Explainability:** Techniques such as **SHAP**, **LIME**, and **DeepLIFT** will be applied for AI/ML models.
    
*   **Scenario Analysis:** The model's ability to predict demand under varying conditions.
    
*   **Model Efficiency:** Measured by processing time on large datasets.
    

Deliverables
------------

*   **Proof of Concept:** A working prototype of the demand forecasting model.
    
*   **Final Report:** A detailed explanation of the methodology and findings.
    
*   **Presentation:** Summary of results highlighting the key insights from the prototype.
    

Workstreams
-----------

1.  **Team Alignment & Project Coordination**
    
    *   Kickoff meeting, data collection, project scope definition, and coordination.
        
2.  **Data Engineering & Model Building**
    
    *   Build and evaluate traditional forecasting models (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) and advanced AI/ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM).
        
3.  **Business Alignment & Analyses**
    
    *   Ensure outputs align with business objectives and conduct scenario analysis.
